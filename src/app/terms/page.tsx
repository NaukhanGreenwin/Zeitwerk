            <h3>3.2 Work Product</h3>

                property or third-party licenses incorporated therein.
            </p>
            <h3>3.3 Retained Rights</h3>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding any transfer of ownership, Zeitwerk retains an
                irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any
                general methodologies, frameworks, tools, know-how, and
                techniques developed or refined during an engagement, provided
                such use does not disclose Client confidential information.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>
                Each party (the &quot;Receiving Party&quot;) agrees to hold in
                strict confidence all proprietary, technical, financial,
                operational, and business information disclosed by the other
                party (the &quot;Disclosing Party&quot;) in connection with an
                engagement (&quot;Confidential Information&quot;). The Receiving
                Party shall not disclose Confidential Information to any third
                party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party,
                except to its employees, agents, or subcontractors who have a
                legitimate need to know and who are bound by obligations of
                confidentiality no less restrictive than those contained herein.
            </p>
            <p>
                The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to
                information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available through
                no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) was rightfully known to the
                Receiving Party prior to disclosure; (c) is independently
                developed without use of Confidential Information; or (d) is
                required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order,
                provided the Receiving Party gives prompt notice to the
                Disclosing Party. The obligations under this Section shall
                survive termination of these Terms for a period of three (3)
                years.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Fees and Payment</h2>
            <p>
                Fees for Services shall be as set forth in the applicable SOW.
                Unless otherwise agreed in writing, all invoices are due and
                payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date. Overdue
                amounts shall accrue interest at the lesser of one and one-half
                percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by
                applicable law. The Client shall be responsible for all
                applicable taxes, excluding taxes on Zeitwerk&#39;s net income.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Representations and Warranties</h2>
            <h3>6.1 Mutual Representations</h3>
            <p>
                Each party represents and warrants that: (a) it has full power
                and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under
                these Terms; and (b) the execution of these Terms does not
                conflict with any other agreement to which it is a party.
            </p>
            <h3>6.2 Zeitwerk Warranty</h3>

                of this warranty shall be re-performance of the non-conforming
                Services, provided that written notice of the alleged
                non-conformance is delivered within thirty (30) days of the

            <h2>10. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance
                with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of
                Canada applicable therein, without regard to conflict of laws
                principles. The parties irrevocably attorn to the exclusive
                jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario, sitting
                in the City of Toronto, for any dispute arising out of or in
                connection with these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to initiating any formal legal proceedings, the parties
                agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute through
                direct negotiation for a period of not less than thirty (30)
                days following written notice of the dispute.
            </p>

            <h2>11. General Provisions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms, together with
                    any applicable SOW and our Privacy Policy, constitute the
                    entire agreement between the parties and supersede all prior
                    or contemporaneous understandings, negotiations, and
                    communications, whether written or oral.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of these
                    Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a
                    court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions
                    shall continue in full force and effect.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Waiver.</strong> No failure or delay by either party
                    in exercising any right under these Terms shall constitute a
                    waiver of that right, nor shall any single or partial
                    exercise preclude further exercise of that or any other
                    right.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer
                    these Terms, or any rights or obligations hereunder, without
                    our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms freely
                    in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Neither party shall be liable
                    for any failure or delay in performance due to causes beyond
                    its reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of
                    God, natural disasters, pandemics, war, terrorism, labour
                    disputes, government actions, or failures of
                    telecommunications or power supply.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Amendment.</strong> We reserve the right to modify
                    these Terms at any time. Material changes will be reflected
                    by an updated &quot;Last updated&quot; date. Your continued
